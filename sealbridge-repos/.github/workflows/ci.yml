# .github/workflows/ci.yml: GitHub Actions workflow for Continuous Integration.
# This workflow runs on every push and pull request. It performs the following checks:
# 1. Lints and formats the code with Ruff.
# 2. Performs static type checking with MyPy.
# 3. Runs the full unit test suite with Pytest.
# It also ensures that the uv.lock file is consistent with pyproject.toml.

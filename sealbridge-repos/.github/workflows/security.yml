# .github/workflows/security.yml: GitHub Actions workflow for security checks.
# This workflow runs on a weekly schedule. It can be used for tasks such as:
# - Auditing dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
# - Checking for updates to pinned third-party tools (like gitleaks).
# For now, it is a placeholder for future security automation.

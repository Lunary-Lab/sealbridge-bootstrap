# SealBridge Bootstrap - Filesystem Policy
# This file defines the default path inclusion and exclusion rules.
# It is used by the policy engine to prevent the bootstrap process
# from accessing unauthorized locations.

# By default, no paths are explicitly included. This means the bootstrap
# operates in a "deny by default" mode, only allowing writes to its own
# managed directories within XDG_DATA_HOME, XDG_CACHE_HOME, etc.
include: []

# A list of paths to explicitly exclude. This list takes precedence over
# the include list.
#
# The default policy is to FORBID access to the user's workspace directory
# to prevent accidental code modification or data loss.
exclude:
  - "${HOME}/workspace/**"
  - "${HOME}/Documents/**"
  - "${HOME}/Downloads/**"
